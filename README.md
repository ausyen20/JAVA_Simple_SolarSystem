# JAVA_Simple_SolarSystem

In this project, I implemented a simple solar system (including Sun, Earth, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).
User can run the project via main.java.
Each planet orbiting around the Sun with different shape and speeds (the shape and speed may not be accurate), which Sun is static won't be moving in this scenario. 
More in depth, there are stars orbiting around some planet as well, therefore, they will be some stars orbiting dynamically. 
The user can only run the program with no further actions.
